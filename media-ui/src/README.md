Media UI
========

Provides a basic user interface to mark recordings for either copying to a 
USB stick or uploading to the webserver.

Passwords
=========

*Basic*/illusionary security is provided by a password dialog which pops up
before a user can perform any operations. To create a password edit Password.py
and change your_password_here to read whatever the password should be.

Run Password.py and edit /etc/sunra/config.yml, changing the value of ui_hash
to the hash value which was printed after running Password.py
